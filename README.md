# General info

This project is project for engineering work on studies. Based on architecture client-server with relational database. It is a website where the user manages his budget. The user has the option to add: income, expense, cyclic income/expense. The user has check balance in your panel in application but has option check balance on graphical charts. The user can draw motivating quotes to encourage yourself savings.

I know that this code is not beautiful. This was my first big project wherein I had to wrote backend too. Some components are not reused. I'm still learning and now I would do it differently. Maybe in future I change this code on better. I will think about use useReducer that reduce count useState in project. I want reduce count of components because better do less components but reused than more and not reused.
